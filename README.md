The purpose of this project is to create a breast cancer prediction model based on the ”Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set” to aid in the preliminary diagnosis of breast cancer. 
The data set consists of 569 instances, and 31 attributes broadly classify the diagnosis as either ’Malignant’ or ’Benign’. The project also compares four models namely ”Logistic Regression”, 
”Support Vector Machine”, ”Random Forest” and ”Decision tree” to predict the best model yielding high performance by evaluating the model on these classifiers. Where 5-fold cross-validation is applied and 
training performed for preliminary result analysis based on Accuracy and Precision. The results obtained from preliminary analysis point to Logistic Regression being the favorable model.
